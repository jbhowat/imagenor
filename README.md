# Imagenor
## Daily Dall-E Image Generation Competition

WORK IN PROGRESS

### About:
I created Imagenor as a clean-slate product inspired by the concept of a project I contributed to called AI-M-Funny. 
AI-M-Funny was a short-term (2 day) group project, and because of that I decided to start from scratch so that I could experiment with some different structure, design, and functional choices as I want Imagenor to be able to scale and be deployed publicly. If you're interested, the AI-M-Funny repo can be found <a href='https://github.com/ai-m-funny/ai-m-funny-main'>here</a>. 

### Technologies:
