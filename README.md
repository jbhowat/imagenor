# Imagenor
## Daily Dall-E Image Generation Competition

WORK IN PROGRESS

### About:
I created Imagenor as a clean-slate product inspired by the concept of a project I contributed to called AI-M-Funny. 
AI-M-Funny was a short-term (2 day) group project, and because of that I decided to start from scratch so that I could experiment with some different structure, design, and functional choices as I want Imegenor to be able to scale and be deployed publicly. 

### Technologies:
Next.js | TypeScript | React | MUI | Firebase
